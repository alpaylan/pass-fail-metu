 ## Hello Friends,

 This site is about a system different from the current grade system named optional pass / fail (elective pass / fail) which we think will be beneficial to the disadvantages we experience as students in the environment of chaos and disorder caused by the Covid-19 Outbreak.  We also intend to inform you about up to date status of the proccedings conducted for the purpose of a system change.

 ### Classic Note System

 It is a credit grading system applied in METU, where each course has + (lab / recit hour) / 2 credits.  Unconditional passing is between AA-CC, conditional passing  is between  DC / DD whereas FD / FF is called course failure.


### Optional Pass / Fail - Elective Pass / Fail

 In our country it is approved by  [Koç University](http://alperenkeles.me/pass-fail-metu/koc-mail.jpg), [Boğaziçi University](http://alperenkeles.me/pass-fail-metu/boun-mail)  , [Sabancı University](http://alperenkeles.me/pass-fail-metu/sabanci-mail.jpg), [Bilkent University](http://alperenkeles.me/pass-fail-metu/bilkent-mail)  and adopted as an alternative grading system   by leading institutions worldwide, such as MIT, Berkeley, Northwestern University, University of Michigan, Harvard University, Washington State University, Caltech, Stanford University.

 The P / F system is a system where students can count the courses they have passed (AA / DD) as **pass**, then they can take the courses they have connected and graduate as well, but the course does not have an affect on GPA / CGPA.


We will try to eliminate the questions in your mind by examining the various cases of the system as follows. For any questions in relation please [contact](http://alperenkeles.me/pass-fail-metu/contact/).

 - **For Students in Probation Status:**

Let Ali be a student in probation with a 1.97 GPA.

 Let's assume that Ali takes 3 courses for simplicity.

 Giving the A, B, C courses with grades DD, CB, CB respectively, Ali's average will remain at 1.99 under normal conditions, meanwhile in the new system DD has been counted as * pass *, making the GPA 2.00, thereby leaving the probation and letting Ali take further next term courses.

- **For Students at the Probation Limit:**

 Hakan is a student with a 2.04 GPA, but he does not have enough opportunities to study at home, maybe he does not have internet, maybe no place or resource to study.  Perhaps, at worse, one or more of his family members is sick or he is sick but he feels that he has to continue his education as much as he can before he suspends his term.

Let Hakan also has taken 3 courses,

 Completing the A, B, C courses with the grades FD, DC, CC respectively, Hakan's average should fall to 1.98 under normal conditions, meanwhile he has opportunity to keep B and C courses as * pass * which results in a GPA of 2.01, thereby keeping him falling to the next probation.  

- **Students Whom will not benefit the System:**

 I want to clarify something, this system will not be useless, unfair, or inefficient for anyone.  There is a misconception that there may be injustice to people who can study at home and continue their education as under normal conditions.  For example, people who want to raise their rankings will not be able to raise their rankings because other people cannot get low marks.  But this is a false notion.  If everyone were under normal circumstances, if we were to implement a pass / fail system, yes it would be a disadvantage.  But people who are concerned about their ranking should realize that in the current system, they will benefit from the worsening conditions at other people's homes.  For example, I'm normally an 4.00 GPA student. Now, due to the conditions I have at home, I will make an average of 2.00.  If we were going to school, I would do 4.00 again.  
Now, in case where we continue with the current system, will people who take advantage of my 2.00 average  and increase their rank notice what kind of injustice they are ignoring?  Therefore, the pass / fail system is the most just and useful system for all students.  Needless to say that there are also the benefits by removing the concerns as well.
